# tiddystay - Browser plugin to stop browser unloading a tiddlywiki (and so prevent loss of unsaved work)

## Getting started (chrome only)
Install by downloading (goto the release https://github.com/buggyj/tiddlystay/releases and download by click the 'source code' zip link) and unzipping (e.g. in a directory called tiddlysave). Then in chrome navigate to chrome://extensions/ and click 'load unpacked extension' and go the tiddlystay/extension/ directory to select the extension (it's the directory containing the 'manifest.json' file).


Note that chome with ask you to disable the 'developer mode' extensions each time you start the browser (but not with linux), as the extension was not loaded from the Chrome Web Store.
